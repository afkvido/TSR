        <p class="punishment-txt">
          * You didn't listen to a Admin
          <br />
          * Your IP has been added to a blacklist which disables the option to
          join TSR
          <br />
          * You are a bad person
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How To Solve -</h3>
        <p class="punishment-txt">
          * Don't be bad and follow the admin rules
          <br />
          * Ask them to be unbanned
