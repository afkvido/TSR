          * You tried to create a alt account to join TSR
          <br />
          * Theres more than one connection/tab to TSR
          <br />
          * You refreshed the page too many times
          <br />
          * A admin kicked you
          <br />
          * You were not acting good
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How To Solve and Avoid -</h3>
        <p class="punishment-txt">
          * Listen to what admins say
          <br />
          * Dont refresh TSR too many times
          <br />
          * Dont make alt accounts as they're not allowed
          <br />
          * Close all tabs/connections of TSR and only have one open
